    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Spider-Man </b>was a radical departure from the established conventions of the comic-book superhero:
        he was a teenage <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Marvel+comics">Marvel comics</a>.created by editor

        and artist <b>steve ditko </b>status beside an older,

        In addition to enhanced speed and strength,
        <a href="#">Silver age of comic book</a> Parker also possessed a precognitive “spider sense”
        that alerted him
        arious useful forms. He also designed and sewed the web-festooned

    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="discription">
        From the beginning, Spider-Man’s behaviour deviated significantly from the prevailing superheroic norms. 
        Instead of selflessly dedicating his superhuman gifts to crime fighting or the general betterment of humankind, 
        the newly empowered Spider-Man cashes in on his talents by becoming a television celebrity. After his first
